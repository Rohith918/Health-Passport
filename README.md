# Health Passport

<p>Health Passport is developed to become a safe, convenient platform for patient data storage and viewing. The application will enable people to follow the health statistics they have over the period and, at the same time, allow the medical experts to evaluate a patient’s medical history to make informed decisions in emergency situations.</p>
<p>I'm especially excited about integrating machine learning capabilities into the project in future iterations. I have several ideas in mind that could significantly enhance its functionality, intelligence, and user experience. Stay tuned for those updates—and in the meantime, don't hesitate to play around and let me know what you think! </p>
